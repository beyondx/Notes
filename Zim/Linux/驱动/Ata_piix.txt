Intel chipsets PATA IDE and SATA in IDE mode

===== Hardware Support =====

This driver supports the **PATA controllers **included with the listed intel chipsets:

    PIIX3
    PIIX4
    ICH0
    ICH
    ICH2
    ICH3
    C-ICH
    ICH4
    ICH5
    6300ESB
    ICH6
    ICH7
    ICH8M 

This driver also supports the__ SATA controllers in IDE mode__ included with the listed intel chipsets:

    ICH5
    6300ESB
    ICH6
    CE3100
    ICH7
    NM10
    631xESB, 632xESB
    ICH8
    ICH9
    ICH10
    IICH
    PCH
    EP80579 

__SATA ports in AHCI mode__(on chipset models supporting this mode) are driven by the AHCI driver.

===== Modes Supported =====

PIO, MWDMA, UDMA

===== Limitations =====

    All DMA modes are disabled if PIIX4E is attached at 450NX
    MWDMA0 is not supported on PATA ports of some ICH
    MWDMA1 is broken on PATA ports of some ICH
    ICH and PCH supporting AHCI or RAID mode will suffer from SATA port sequence shift when switching from AHCI or RAID to IDE mode and vice versa
    Attached storage devices may not be detected on Intel ICH5 series southbridge when all six storage devices are populated
    6 Gb/s SATA devices may not be detected on PCH x5x, xx5x, 34x0
    SATA devices may not be detected at the 3 Gb/s ports of B2 stepping PCH x6x, xx6x
    CE3100 does not support PCI MSI at its SATA controller
    PCI MSI is not yet supported at SATA controllers of ICH5 in non combined mode. As a result legacy PCI interrupts are still used 

===== Known Problems =====

    CE3100 Stepping A0 is not supported because workarounds are needed to fix errata:
        DMA burst size must be 64 bytes at most
        SATA PCI header is not completely PCI compatible
        SATA PCI Device ID is wrong
        SATA memory mapped PCI header is wrong 

===== Module Options =====

None
Programmer documentation

Documentation is available for ICH0, ICH, ICH2, ICH3, ICH4, ICH5 IDE and ICH5 SATA
