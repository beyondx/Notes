====== 5.3 How to specify block lists ======
Created Tuesday 03 August 2010

A block list is used for specifying a file that doesn't appear in the
filesystem, like a chainloader. The syntax is
`[OFFSET]+LENGTH[,[OFFSET]+LENGTH]...'.  Here is an example:

     `0+100,200+1,300+300'

   This represents that GRUB should read blocks 0 through 99, block 200,
and blocks 300 through 599. If you omit an offset, then GRUB assumes
the offset is zero.

   Like the file name syntax (*note File name syntax::), if a blocklist
does not contain a device name, then GRUB uses GRUB's "root device". So
`(hd0,2)+1' is the same as `+1' when the root device is `(hd0,2)'.
