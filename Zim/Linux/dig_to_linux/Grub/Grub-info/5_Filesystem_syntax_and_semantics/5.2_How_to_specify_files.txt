====== 5.2 How to specify files ======
Created Tuesday 03 August 2010

There are two ways to specify files, by "absolute file name" and by
"block list".

   An absolute file name resembles a Unix absolute file name, using `/'
for the directory separator (not `\' as in DOS). One example is
`(hd0,1)/boot/grub/grub.cfg'. This means the file `/boot/grub/grub.cfg'
in the first partition of the first hard disk. If you omit the device
name in an absolute file name, GRUB uses GRUB's "root device"
implicitly. So if you set the root device to, say, `(hd1,1)' by the
command `root' (*note root::), then `/boot/kernel' is the same as
`(hd1,1)/boot/kernel'.
