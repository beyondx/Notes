====== 5.1 How to specify devices ======
Created Tuesday 03 August 2010

The device syntax is like this:

     `(DEVICE[,PART-NUM][,BSD-SUBPART-LETTER])'

   `[]' means the parameter is optional. DEVICE should be either `fd'
or `hd' followed by a digit, like `fd0'.  But you can also set DEVICE
to a hexadecimal or a decimal number which is a BIOS drive number, so
the following are equivalent:

     (hd0)
     (0x80)
     (128)

   PART-NUM represents the partition number of DEVICE, starting from
one for primary partitions and from five for extended partitions, and
BSD-SUBPART-LETTER represents the BSD disklabel subpartition, such as
`a' or `e'.

   A shortcut for specifying BSD subpartitions is
`(DEVICE,BSD-SUBPART-LETTER)', in this case, GRUB searches for the
first PC partition containing a BSD disklabel, then finds the
subpartition BSD-SUBPART-LETTER. Here is an example:

     (hd0,a)

   The syntax `(hd0)' represents using the entire disk (or the MBR when
installing GRUB), while the syntax `(hd0,1)' represents using the first
partition of the disk (or the boot sector of the partition when
installing GRUB).

   If you enabled the network support, the special drive, `(nd)', is
also available. Before using the network drive, you must initialize the
network. *Note Network::, for more information.
