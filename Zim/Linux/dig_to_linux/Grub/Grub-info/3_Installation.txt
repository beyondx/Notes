====== 3 Installation ======
Created Tuesday 03 August 2010

In order to install GRUB as your boot loader, you need to first install
the GRUB system and utilities under your UNIX-like operating system
(*note Obtaining and Building GRUB::). You can do this either from the
source tarball, or as a package for your OS.

   After you have done that, you need to install the boot loader on a
drive (floppy or hard disk). There are two ways of doing that - either
using the utility `grub-install' (*note Invoking grub-install::) on a
UNIX-like OS, or by running GRUB itself from a floppy. These are quite
similar, however the utility might probe a wrong BIOS drive, so you
should be careful.

   Also, if you install GRUB on a UNIX-like OS, please make sure that
you have an emergency boot disk ready, so that you can rescue your
computer if, by any chance, your hard drive becomes unusable
(unbootable).

   GRUB comes with boot images, which are normally put in the directory
`/usr/lib/grub/i386-pc'. Hereafter, the directory where GRUB images are
initially placed (normally `/usr/lib/grub/i386-pc') will be called the
"image directory", and the directory where the boot loader needs to
find them (usually `/boot/grub') will be called the "boot directory".
