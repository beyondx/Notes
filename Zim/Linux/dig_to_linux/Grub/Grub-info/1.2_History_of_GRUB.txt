====== 1.2 History of GRUB ======
Created Tuesday 03 August 2010

GRUB originated in 1995 when Erich Boleyn was trying to boot the GNU Hurd with the University of Utah's Mach 4 microkernel (now known as GNU Mach).  Erich and Brian Ford designed the Multiboot Specification(*note Multiboot Specification: (multiboot)Top.), because they were determined not to add to the large number of mutually-incompatible PC
boot methods.

   Erich then began modifying the FreeBSD boot loader so that it would understand Multiboot. He soon realized that it would be a lot easier to
write his own boot loader from scratch than to keep working on the FreeBSD boot loader, and so GRUB was born.

   Erich added many features to GRUB, but other priorities prevented him from keeping up with the demands of its quickly-expanding user base. In
1999, Gordon Matzigkeit and Yoshinori K. Okuji adopted GRUB as an official GNU package, and opened its development by making the latest
sources available via anonymous CVS. *Note Obtaining and Building GRUB::, for more information.
