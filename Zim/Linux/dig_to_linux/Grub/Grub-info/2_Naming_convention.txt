The device syntax used in GRUB is a wee bit different from what you may have seen before in your operating system(s), and you need to know it so
that you can specify a drive/partition.

   Look at the following examples and explanations:

     (fd0)

   First of all, GRUB requires that the device name be enclosed with`(' and `)'. The `fd' part means that it is a floppy disk. The number`0' is the drive number, which is counted from _zero_. This expression means that GRUB will use the whole floppy disk.

     (hd0,2)

   Here, `hd' means it is a hard disk drive. The first integer `0' indicates the drive number, that is, the first hard disk, while the second integer, `1', indicates the partition number (or the PC slice
number in the BSD terminology). The partition numbers are counted from
_one_, not from zero (as was the case in previous versions of GRUB).
This expression means the second partition of the first hard disk
drive. In this case, GRUB uses one partition of the disk, instead of
the whole disk.

     (hd0,5)

   This specifies the first "extended partition" of the first hard disk
drive. Note that the partition numbers for extended partitions are
counted from `5', regardless of the actual number of primary partitions
on your hard disk.
  (hd1,a)

   This means the BSD `a' partition of the second hard disk. If you
need to specify which PC slice number should be used, use something
like this: `(hd1,1,a)'. If the PC slice number is omitted, GRUB
searches for the first PC slice which has a BSD `a' partition.

   Of course, to actually access the disks or partitions with GRUB, you
need to use the device specification in a command, like `root (fd0)' or
`unhide (hd0,3)'. To help you find out which number specifies a
partition you want, the GRUB command-line (*note Command-line
interface::) options have argument completion. This means that, for
example, you only need to type

     root (

   followed by a <TAB>, and GRUB will display the list of drives,
partitions, or file names. So it should be quite easy to determine the
name of your target partition, even with minimal knowledge of the
syntax.

   Note that GRUB does _not_ distinguish IDE from SCSI - it simply
counts the drive numbers from zero, regardless of their type. Normally,
any IDE drive number is less than any SCSI drive number, although that
is not true if you change the boot sequence by swapping IDE and SCSI
drives in your BIOS.

   Now the question is, how to specify a file? Again, consider an
example:

     (hd0,1)/vmlinuz

   This specifies the file named `vmlinuz', found on the first
partition of the first hard disk drive. Note that the argument
completion works with file names, too.
