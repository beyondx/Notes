In KDE Software Compilation 4, Sonnet is a **multilingual spell check program**. Sonnet replaces kspell2 that was created for KDE3. The two main goals for Sonnet's development were a simpler API, wider language support and performance. Notable improvements in Sonnet over kspell2 are:

* Automatic language detection, a language can be identified with as little as 20 characters of text. Even multiple languages in the same document can be detected and spell checked correctly
* Better performance
* Improvements in spell checking languages like Thai and Japanese
* Simpler design, kspell2 consisted of 7 components and a complicated API. Sonnet is a single component and aims to provide a simpler API
* The user can select a primary and backup dictionary, an example given was a doctor who frequently uses terms from a medical dictionary. Words that would not appear in a regular dictionary would be corrected by the backup dictionary that contains medical terms.
