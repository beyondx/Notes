KIO: Network-enabled File Management
4.0

==== Overview | File Selector ====

This library implements almost all the **file management functions **you will ever need. In fact, the KDE file manager, Konqueror also uses this to provide its** network-enabled** file management.

The easiest way to use this library from a KDE application is via the **KIO::NetAccess** class (for easy synchronous access) or via the **KIO::Job** class (for more complex asynchronous jobs).

This library also implements the **System Configuration Cache** (KSycoca), and the **KDE file selector widget** (see the page on the file selector widget).

See also:
    KMimeType: Represents the type of a file.
    KService: A service is a library or application that can deal with a certain set of mimetypes.
    KServiceType: A service type is a group of services with similar functionality. For example, KOffice's filters have the service type KOfficeFilter.
    KServiceTypeTrader: Can be used to query for which services implement a given servicetype. Has its own language, in order to allow complex queries.
    KMimeTypeTrader: Can be used to query for which services can handle a given mimetype. Has its own language, in order to allow complex queries.
