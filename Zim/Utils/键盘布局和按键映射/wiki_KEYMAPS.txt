===== KEYMAP =====
The **KEYMAP** variable is specified in the __/etc/vconsole.conf__ file. It defines what keymap the keyboard is in the virtual consoles. Keytable files are provided by the **kbd** package.

===== Keyboard layouts =====
This is the list of known keymap settings to work for the corresponding **keyboard layouts**. Most keymaps can be found in the **/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386**/layout (__layout=qwerty, azerty, dvorak, etc__.) directory.

Less common but nonetheless useful keymaps for Arch Linux are found in the /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/architecture (architecture=mac, sun, etc.) directory.
Note: In an X session, you can use setxkbmap to instantly apply keyboard layout: setxkbmap -layout dvorak

Note: If these keymaps do not work for you, make sure the keymap file exists in /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/ using find: find /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/ -name "*[your desired keymap]*"

===== Configuring the Console Keymap =====

1. cd to /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty

2. Copy your default keymap (us.map.gz) to a new file personal.map.gz

3. gunzip the new map file

4. Edit personal.map using your favorite editor. Examples:
      __Make the Right Alt key same as Left Alt key (Emacs)__
		change the line include "linux-with-alt-and-altgr" to include "linux-with-two-alt-keys"
     Swap CapsLock with Escape (Vim)
		make keycode 1 = Caps_Lock and keycode 58 = Escape
     Make CapsLock another Control key
               change the line keycode 58 = Caps_Lock to keycode 58 = Control
     Swap CapsLock with Left Control key
               make keycode 29 = Caps_Lock and keycode 58 = Control
注意：可以使用showkey命令查看，虚拟终端环境中某个按键的keycode（对于X 环境可以使用xev命令）。

5. gzip the map file
Change the default keyboard layout file that will be used by editing /etc/vconsole.conf (you might have to create this file) and changing the line that says KEYMAP=us to KEYMAP=personal

6. Reboot to use your keymap the way nature intended (or run "__loadkeys personal__")
