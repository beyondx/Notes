Hi,

need some recipe to reproduce.
Completion in IPython works fine here with TAB.

Did you patch against current trunk?

BTW have a look at

defcustom py-complete-function

thanks,

Andreas

===== changed key map name to match changes to python mode =====

This is a minor change to handling the python-mode key mappings. In reversion 752
( http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~python-mode-devs/python-mode/python-mode/revision/752 ) the name of the map was changed from py-mode-map to python-mode-map.

This isn't in any distributions yet, so I am not sure how you want to deal with this.
