Created Tuesday 10 January 2012

===== Installation =====

Before installing emacs-w3m, you have to check whether your environment meets the requirements.

Installing emacs-w3m on UNIX-like systems

    At the first, run the configure script.

        % ./configure

    If you've installed APEL, FLIM or something in non-standard directories other than the default load-path, you must specify them using the --with-addpath option as follows:

        % ./configure --with-addpath=/opt/share/apel:/opt/share/flim

    Next, execute the following commands to install emacs-w3m to an appropriate directory.

        % make
        # make install

    If you are using Emacs 21.1 and newer or XEmacs, you had better install icon image files. To do this:

        # make install-icons

    You can also install emacs-w3m as an XEmacs package using make install-package instead of make install.

        % make
        # make install-package

    In this case, you don't have to execute make install-icons.

===== Installing on non-UNIX-like systems =====

    If you cannot execute the configure script on your system, or if no make command is available, execute the following command:

        # emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -l w3mhack.el NONE -f w3mhack-nonunix-install

    If APEL, FLIM (or any other library) aren't installed in the ordinary places, the installer will leave them out. In such a case, it is necessary to tell those places to the installer as shown below:

        # emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -l w3mhack.el //c/share/apel://c/share/flim -f w3mhack-nonunix-install

===== Configuration =====

Put this line into your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'w3m-load)

Just type M-x w3m, and you can use emacs-w3m.

In order to handle text/html part with emacs-w3m under SEMI MUAs such as Wanderlust, you have to put the following line in your ~/.emacs file:

    (require 'mime-w3m)

For more detail, see Info manual.
