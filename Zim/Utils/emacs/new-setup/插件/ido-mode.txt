===== Using IDO =====

    ;;in the .emacs
    (require ‘ido)
    (ido-mode t)

===== 1. =====
To switch between buffers, press “__C-x b__”, then:
    type some characters appearing in the buffer name(只要name中包含输入的字符即可), RET to visit the buffer in the front the list.
    use __C-s __(next) or__ C-r __(previous) to move through the list.
    __[Tab]__ display possible completion in a buffer (or visit the buffer if there is only one possible completion).
    use __C-f __to fall back to find file (without ido-mode) or __C-b__ to fall back to switch to buffer (without ido-mode).

===== 2. =====
To find a file, press “__C-x C-f__”.

    type some characters appearing in the file name, RET to choose the file or directory in the front of the list.
    C-s (next) or C-r (previous) to move through the list.
    [Tab] - display possible completion in a buffer (or open the file or go down the directory if there is only one possible completion).
    **RET - type to go down inside the directory in front of the list.**
**    [backspace] - go up to the parent directory.**
    // - go to the root directory.** 可以用在文件路径的任何地方**
    ~/ - go to the home directory.
    C-f - to go back temporarily to the normal find-file.
    C-d - enter Dired for this directory (used to be C-x C-d in older versions)
   __ C-j __- create a new file named with the text you entered (note: this is needed if the text you entered matches an existing file, because RET would open the existing one)

===== 3. =====
To restrict the list after a first filtering:(缩小检索范围)

    type some characters appearing in the buffer/file name(say .cpp)
    type **C-SPC (C-@)**
    continue as normal with a list containing only the filtered names

===== 4. =====
Recently visited directories:

    type__ M-p__ and __M-n__ to change to previous/next directories from the history
    __M-s __to search for a file matching your input
   __ M-k__ to remove the current directory from the history
    directories are added to the history by navigating inside them via RET 

===== 5. =====
The documentation for these keys is available via

    M-x describe-function RET ido-find-file RET
    C-h f ido-find-file RET
