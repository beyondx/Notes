====== ac-math ======
Created Tuesday 10 January 2012

Repo: svn checkout http://ac-math.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ac-math-read-only
Homepage: http://code.google.com/p/ac-math/

This is an add-on which defines three ac-sources for the__ auto-complete__ package:

* ac-source-latex-commands - input latex commands
* ac-source-math-latex - input math latex tags (active only in math environments) 
* ac-source-math-unicode - input of unicode symbols (active everywhere except math environments) 

To start the math completion by typing the prefix "\" key. To select the completion type RET.

Depending on the context the unicode symbol or latex \tag will be inserted.

===== Activation =====

You must have auto-complete package installed.

Download ac-math.el and put it into your load-path directory.

This is an example of how to activate the 'ac-math' in latex-mode:

(require 'ac-math)

(add-to-list 'ac-modes 'latex-mode)   ; make auto-complete aware of {{{latex-mode}}}

(defun ac-latex-mode-setup ()         ; add ac-sources to default ac-sources
  (setq ac-sources
     (append '(ac-source-math-unicode ac-source-math-latex ac-source-latex-commands)
               ac-sources))
)

(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'ac-latex-mode-setup)

If you are using 'flyspell' you would also like to activate the workaround:

(ac-flyspell-workaround)

===== Unicode Input =====

To use unicode in full force with LaTeX you will need XeTeX bundle.

By default unicode input (ac-source-math-unicode) is not activated in latex math environments. To activate it do

(setq ac-math-unicode-in-math-p t)

You can always call UNDO to insert LaTeX command instead of Unicode character. For instance \alp RET inserts the character, next undo reinserts \alpha. Thus, you might consider removing ac-source-math-latex altogether from the list of ac-sources to increase the completion speed:

(defun ac-latex-mode-setup ()         
  (setq ac-sources
     (append '(ac-source-math-unicode ac-source-latex-commands)
               ac-sources))
)

Unicode input is not restricted to LaTeX modes and is particularly useful in org-mode with it's powerful exporting facilities, or web development tools where unicode is crucial.

Suppose you want it for mode XXX:

(require 'ac-math)

(add-to-list 'ac-modes 'XXX-mode)

(defun ac-XXX-mode-setup ()
   (add-to-list 'ac-sources 'ac-source-math-unicode)
)

(add-hook 'XXX-mode-hook 'ac-XXX-mode-setup)

===== Other Sources =====

Here is how to make the TaTeX completion work everywhere (default is only in math mode):

(defvar ac-source-math-latex-everywere
'((candidates . ac-math-symbols-latex)
  (prefix . "\\\\\\(.*\\)")
  (action . ac-math-action-latex)
  (symbol . "l")
 ))

Here is how to make unicode completion work with prefix "%" (prefix is deleted automatically on completion):

(defvar ac-source-math-unicode-on-%
'((candidates . ac-math-symbols-unicode)
  (prefix . "%\\(.*\\)")
  (action . ac-math-action-unicode)
  (symbol . "u")
 ))

Please let me know if you want anything different from above.
