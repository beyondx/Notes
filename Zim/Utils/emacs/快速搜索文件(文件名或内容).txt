Emacs – 用emacs的文件夹中搜索文件

find-name-dired 在文件夹中搜索文件（按名字，递归）
find-grep-dired 同上（搜索文件中的内容，递归）
find-dired 同上（自由度最高，所有选项自己设置，需要熟悉find）

Dired and find

You can select a set of files for display in a Dired buffer more
flexibly by using the find utility to choose the files.

find-name-dired

To search for files with names matching a wildcard pattern use M-x
find-name-dired. It reads arguments directory and pattern, and chooses
all the files in directory or its subdirectories whose individual names
match pattern.

The files thus chosen are displayed in a Dired buffer in which the
ordinary Dired commands are available.

find-grep-dired

If you want to __test the contents of files__, rather than their names, use
M-x find-grep-dired. This command reads two minibuffer arguments,
directory and regexp; it chooses all the files in directory or its
subdirectories that contain a match for regexp. It works by running the
programs find and grep. See also M-x grep-find, in Compilation.
Remember to write the regular expression for grep, not for Emacs. (An
alternative method of showing files whose contents match a given regexp
is the % g regexp command, see Marks vs Flags.)

find-dired

The most general command in this series is M-x find-dired, which lets
you specify any condition that find can test. It takes two minibuffer
arguments, directory and find-args; it runs find in directory, passing
find-args to tell find what condition to test. To use this command, you
need to know how to use find.

others

M-x locate provides a similar interface to the locate program. M-x
locate-with-filter is similar, but keeps only lines matching a given
regular expression.

The format of listing produced by these commands is controlled by the
variable find-ls-option, whose default value specifies using options
-ld for ls. If your listings are corrupted, you may need to change the
value of this variable.
