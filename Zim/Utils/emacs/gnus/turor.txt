===== 1. Starting Gnus =====
If your system administrator has set things up properly, starting Gnus and reading news is extremely easy--you just type __M-x gnus__ in your Emacs. If not, you should customize the variable** gnus-select-method** as described in 1.1 Finding the News. For a minimal setup for posting should also customize the variables **user-full-name** and **user-mail-address.**

If you want to start Gnus in a different frame, you can use the command __M-x gnus-other-frame__ instead.

If things do not go smoothly at startup, you have to twiddle some variables in your `**~/.gnus.el**' file. This file is similar to `~/.emacs', but is read when Gnus starts.
