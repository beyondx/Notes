Cscope is very good as "find symbol" usage tool. It is very fast.
Etags will show you your class hierarchy and will help you to find method definition/declaration.
So these two tools are must have and they are independent.
Cedet. It is kind of replacement of these two tools above with additional features. So your choice either cscope/etags or cedet.
