====== Synchronizing Git repositories without a server ======
Created Monday 16 May 2011

See this blog post "Synchronizing Git repositories without a server " (by Victor Costan).

    This post describes a method for pushing changes between two repositories without using a server with network connections to both hosts having repositories

Start up by creating a repository on the USB stick.

mkdir /path/to/usb/stick/repository.git
git clone --local --bare . /path/to/usb/stick/repository.git

Then register the repository on the USB stick as a remote repository, and push the desired branch to it (if you don't want to push master, substitute your desired branch).

git remote add usb file:///path/to/usb/stick/repository.git
git push usb master

In the future, you can treat the USB repository as any other remote repository. Just make sure it's mounted :) For instance, the following pushes new changes to the USB repository.

git push usb

On the receiving end, mount the USB stick, and use a file URL for the repository

file:///path/to/usb/stick/repository.git

A few handy commands:

# cloning the repository on the USB stick
git clone file:///path/to/usb/stick/repository.git
# updating a repository cloned from the USB stick using the above command
git pull origin
# adding the USB stick repository as a remote for an existing repository
git remote add usb file:///path/to/usb/stick/repository.git
# updating from a remote repository configured using the above command
git pull usb master
