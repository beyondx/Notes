====== CFI for gas ======
Created Sunday 23 December 2012

Modern ABIs don't require frame pointers to be used in functions.
Howerver missing FPs bring difficulties when doing a backtrace.
One solutions is to provide Dwarf-2 CFI(call frame information) data
for each such function. This can be easily done for example by GCC in
its output, but isn't that easy to write by hand for pure assembler functions.

With the help of these .cfi_* directives one can ass appropriate unwind info 
into his asm source without too much trouble.
