====== Django static media ======
Created Monday 24 October 2011

I spent too long tonight figuring out a weird problem.

On a dev server, I was using **django.views.static.serve** to serve media files. But it was returning 404 (not found) for any file.

The requests for media files weren’t even showing up in Django’s **built-in server’s** output. That had me baffled until I dug deep enough in Django’s code to figure it out.

The **ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX** was the same as **MEDIA_URL.** That was it.

Django’s built-in server doesn’t log requests for **admin media**, so that’s why there was no log output.

The built-in server also **handles admin media separately**, so when I tried to request a media file, it intercepted and looked for it in the admin media.

-------------------------------------------------------

    The term “media” always struck me as a poor choice, as it means both everything and nothing and is guaranteed to confuse a Django newcomer (as it once did confuse me). Which is why my Django deployments are set up with what I consider less confusing terminology:

    /upload – the stuff that users uploaded to the server, i.e. what Django refers to as media (served under MEDIA_URL and stored in MEDIA_ROOT on the filesystem).

Django将用户上传的文件称为media

    /static – the static part of my project/site, such as icons, Javascript files, CSS, etc. (I keep this well separate from /upload, as it is truly static and lives in version control, unlike /upload) 

被项目或APP中不变的文件称为static

    /adminmedia – the static parts of Django’s admin interface, which is served under ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX and part of Django. Arguably this should live under __/static/admin__, but I prefer the clean separation in case I need to more one or the other to a separate host for whatever reason (performance, CDN, …)

Django admin 界面的静态文件称为ADMIN_MEDIA，它的位置在 ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX 变量中指定，默认值为/static/admin, 一旦改变该值
则相应目录中一定要有admin media文件。

> MEDIA_ROOT

the directory where you upload media

> MEDIA_URL

the url where your site media - css, js, icons etc live

> ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX

the alias to where the admin media lives - django/contrib/admin/media
