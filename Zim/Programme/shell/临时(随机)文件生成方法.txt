Various methods exists to create a** random temporary** file name. This is useful if your application/shell scripting needs temporary unique file names.

===== Method #1: Use of $RANDOM bash shell variable =====

1) At shell prompt type command:
# echo __$RANDOM__

You will get random value every time. This variable can be use to create unique file name

===== Method # 2 Use of $$ variable =====

This is old and classic method. __$$__ **shell variable **returns the current running process this can be use to create unique temporary file as demonstrated in following script:
vi random2.bash

#!/bin/bash
#
TFILE="/tmp/__$(basename $0)__.$$.tmp"
ls > $TFILE
echo "See diretory listing in $TFILE"

Save the script and execute as follows:
$ chmod +x random2.bash
$ ./ random2.bash

===== Method # 3 Use of mktemp or tempfile utility =====

As name suggest both makes unique temporary filename. Just type mktemp at shell prompt to create it:
$ __mktemp__
Output:
/tmp/tmp.IAnO5O
OR
$ __tempfile__
Output:
/tmp/IAnO5O

Make a unique __temporary directory__ instead of a file using –d option to both of them
$ mktemp –d
$ tempfile –d

Both mktemp or tempfile provides the shell scripts facility to use temporary files** in safe manner** hence it is highly recommended to use them.
