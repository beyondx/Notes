                                  A flow-chart diagram showing how FUSE works

Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is __a loadable kernel module__ for Unix-like computer operating systems that __lets non-privileged users create their own file systems__ without editing kernel code. This is achieved by running file system code in user space while the FUSE module provides only __a "bridge"__ to the actual kernel interfaces.

Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License and the GNU Lesser General Public License, FUSE is free software. The FUSE system was originally part of A Virtual Filesystem (AVFS), but has since split off into its own project on SourceForge.net.

FUSE is available for Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD (as puffs), OpenSolaris, and OS X.[1] It was officially merged into the mainstream Linux kernel tree in kernel version 2.6.14.[2]

===== Virtual file system =====
FUSE is particularly useful for writing virtual file systems. Unlike traditional file systems that essentially save data to and retrieve data from disk, virtual filesystems do not actually store data themselves. __They act as a view or translation of an existing file system or storage device__.

In principle, any resource available to a FUSE implementation can be exported as a file system.

===== Examples =====
Wuala: A multi-platform, Java-based fully OS integrated distributed file system. Using FUSE, MacFUSE and Callback File System respectively for file system integration, in addition to a Java-based app accessible from any Java-enabled web browser.
MyVDrive: Fully OS integrated Internet file system using FUSE.
__WebDrive:__ A commercial filesystem implementing WebDAV, SFTP, FTP, FTPS and Amazon S3
jSYS: A commercial software to create jails and virtual filesystems in user-space using FUSE.
Transmit: A commercial FTP client that also adds the ability to mount WebDAV, SFTP, FTP and Amazon S3 servers as disks in Finder, via MacFUSE.
ExpanDrive: A commercial filesystem implementing SFTP/FTP/FTPS using FUSE

Sun Microsystems's Lustre cluster filesystem will use FUSE to allow it to run in userspace, so that a FreeBSD port is possible.[3] However, the ZFS-Linux port of Lustre will be running ZFS's DMU (Data Management Unit) in userspace.[4]
