====== What is Texinfo ======
Created Wednesday 07 September 2011

===== Texinfo =====
 is a documentation system that uses** one source file to produce both on-line information and printed output.** So instead of writing two different documents, one for the on-line help and the other for a typeset manual, you need write __only one__ document source file. When the work is revised, you need only revise one document. By convention, Texinfo source file names end with a **.texi or .texinfo** extension.

Texinfo is a __macro language__, somewhat similar to LaTeX, but with slightly less expressive power. Its appearance is of course rather similar to any TeX-based macro language, except that its** macros start with @** rather than the \ that’s more commonly used in TeX systems.

You can write and format Texinfo files into __Info__ files within GNU emacs, and read them using the emacs Info reader. You can also format Texinfo files into Info files using **makeinfo** and read them using info, so you’re not dependent on emacs. The distribution includes a Perl script,** texi2html**, that will convert Texinfo sources into HTML: the language is a far better fit to HTML than is LaTeX, so that the breast-beating agonies of converting LaTeX to HTML are largely avoided.

Finally, of course, you can also print the files, or convert them to PDF using PDFTeX.
